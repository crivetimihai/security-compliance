# Meeting your security and compliance goals
{: #overview}

For highly regulated industries, such as financial services, achieving continuous security within a cloud environment is an important first step towards protecting customer and application data. Historically, that process has been difficult and manual, which placed your organization at risk. But, with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} you can integrate automatic security checks into every day workflows that are designed to minimize risk.

## Defining your strategy
{: #strategy}


Security and compliance are two concepts that are often spoken of interchangeably. But, there are some significant differences between them. For example, compliance regulations change slowly and are generally measured as a snapshot in time. Whereas security threats are constant and always changing. Depending on the role that you fill in your organization, you might focus on ensuring compliance to industry regulations or you might focus more on mitigating incoming security threats.

Most often, as a compliance focal, you need to adhere to multiple regulations or laws at once. You are responsible for understanding and implementing the controls that are required for your business. You also have a responsibility to gather evidence that proves to external auditors that your compliance checks are in place and in continuous compliance. To get started, [create a collector](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-collector#create-collector) to assess your available resources and their configuration. 

As a security focal, your focus is threat detection and mitigation. To address your main concerns, you need to be sure that everyone in your organization is following the mandated guidelines. By building security checks into everyday workflows, you can regulate the way that resources can be provisioned and configured across all of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. To get started, [define a rule](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-rules).



## How it works
{: #how-it-works}

The {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} is comprised on three different components: Security and compliance posture monitoring, configuration governance, and security insights. Each component is designed to help you to be secure and compliant in different ways.

### Security and compliance posture management
{: #posture-management}

When you work with the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, you interact with several interrelated components, including profiles, config rules, and scopes. Check out the following diagram to see how the components work together to help you manage and validate compliance in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

![The diagram shows how you can create profiles and rules, enforce them across scopes that you specify to continuously validate your resources for compliance. The information in the diagram is explained in further detail in the surrounding text.](images/posture-management.svg){: caption="Figure 1. How the security and compliance posture monitoring components work together" caption-side="bottom"}


As a security or compliance focal, you create credentials and install a collector to get started. Then, you create profiles and scopes to start validating specific sections of your business by using specific regulations or requirements. With everything configured, the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} works in the background to monitor for potential risk by scanning your resources on a schedule that you determined. When the scans of your resources are complete, the service does a quick calculation to determine your security and compliance score before displaying the score and your detailed results in a dashboard. From the dashboard, you can download a detailed report that you can use to provide evidence to stakeholders or external auditors.

&ast;*Security and compliance posture monitoring is available for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and on-premises environments.*

### Configuration governance
{: #config-governance}

By creating config rules, you can standardize resource configuration across your accounts. Config rules are guardrails for how your resources can be provisioned and configured. By attaching the rules to a scope, you can monitor and enforce your rules in only the areas that you want to target. For example, if you wanted to disable public access for your production accounts but allow it in a testing account, you can do that. Through rule enforcement, you can code with confidence that your configurations follow the guidelines that you put in place, which significantly decreases the likelihood of a misconfiguration-related security issue.

&ast;*Configuration governance is available for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} enterprise accounts only.*


### Security insights
{: #security-insights}

With [security insights](/docs/security-advisor?topic=security-advisor-integrations), you can analyze your cluster network communication and your account activity to detect potential threats. With network insights, you can monitor and analyze cluster network communication, both incoming and outgoing between your Kubernetes cluster and external entities. With Activity Insights, you can monitor and analyze your Activity Tracker with LogDNA logs to identify unauthorized or suspicious activity that is made by users or apps.

&ast;*Security insights is available for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} only.*Â
